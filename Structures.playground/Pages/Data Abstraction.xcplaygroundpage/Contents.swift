## Data Abstraction
 
 Like any form of data abstraction, structs simplify the code that works with related data. In the case of the `Song` struct, you no longer have to worry about three parallel arrays. Using data abstraction can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain.
  
 To see the benefit of data abstraction firsthand, complete the exercises below.

 - callout(Exercise): 
 Complete the missing code to process the parallel arrays from the first page of the playground.

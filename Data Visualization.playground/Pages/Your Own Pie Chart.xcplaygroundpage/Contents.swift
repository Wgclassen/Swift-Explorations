## Your Own Data
 
 Now create your own data set. You might want to visualize how much of a 24-hour day you spend in different activities. Or ask a set of friends to choose their favorite subject at school. Or you can look online to find an existing data set that would be interesting to play with.

 - callout(Exercise): Make a pie chart using your own data. Remember, you can create a key using the `addKeyItem(withLabel:color:)` function.
